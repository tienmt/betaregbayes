Description: This package allows user to fit sparse Beta regression for bounded response in (0,1) via Bayesian approach with Horseshoe prior. 
            The main algorithm is a novel Gibbs sampler allowing to obtain samples from the posterior. Credible intervals can be obtained directly. Variable selection is also returned.
